This is a personal research project into how to use 64-bit assembly language on
Unix-based systems. For want of a better name, I named it after the document
which describes its ABI. It's likely to be fairly simple stuff, but with plenty
of comments as I will most likely post the source on my blog at 
http://codetrauma.wordpress.com as I go along.
